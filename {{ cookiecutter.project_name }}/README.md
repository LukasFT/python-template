# Basic set up of Python project

This is meant to be used as a starting point if you are making a simple Python project that you want to be able to run using Docker and develop with VS Code devcontainers. Jupyter Notebooks are also supported in the devcontainers.

This project is mostly for my own use, but feel free to use it if you find it helpful.
